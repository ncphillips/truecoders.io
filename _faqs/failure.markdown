It is in the best interest of TrueCoders to make sure you graduate the course with flying colors. However, there are several ways you can fail the course:

* Consisten lack of attendance and/or punctuality
* Misconduct or law breaking of any kind
* Consistently failing course material and assignments
* Disregard or disrespect for instructors
