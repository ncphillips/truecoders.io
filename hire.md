# Hiring TrueCoders

Here's just a few benefits of hiring TrueCoders:

* US-based
* Highly trained with hands-on experience
* Affordable rates
* Month to month billing arrangements

With a focus on education, best practice training, and enforcement of the software lifecycle,  we can produce quality teams at pricing below the US average.

Having a senior resource doing code review we're able to produce a very high level of output from our less seasoned alumni while training them along the way.

Our bootcamps allow us to scale to demand with relative ease if your needs outgrow us then we have more alumni coming.
